    <h1>About</h1>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>In 2015, Brian Brue founded Blues and Brews so that anyone who needed a quiet place to think and work as well as a refreshing beverage could find that place and stay awhile. Brue used to frequent coffee shops throughout his school years to avoid his noisy home and constantly thought about starting one of his own. 8 years later in 2023, Brue passed away and left his beloved refreshment store to his family, but his legacy shall live on in the hearts of coffee lovers everywhere. </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>Our vision is to bring everyone together with a love for coffee and smooth music. Our vision is to provide a place for people to be where they can have a moment and a drink for themselves or share a moment with someone special. Since we started 10 years ago, we've remained dedicated to providing the best environment and the most refreshing drinks possible.</p>
